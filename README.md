# Solar System
This is a javascript project i made for school.

The idea is to simply have all the elements move towards a point instead of animating it there via for example jQuery,

With this method you can change the point that the elements are moving towards and by doing so create smooth stateless animations.

This also removes the risk of an element flickering between two states of an animation if you change the animation before the other one is finished.
