<p>This is a javascript project i made for school.</p>

<p>The idea is to simply have all the elements move towards a point instead of animating it there via for example jQuery,</p>

<p>With this method you can change the point that the elements are moving towards and by doing so create smooth stateless animations.</p>

<p>This also removes the risk of an element flickering between two states of an animation if you change the animation before the other one is finished.</p>
