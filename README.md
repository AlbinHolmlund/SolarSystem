# Solar System
This is a javascript project i made for school.

The idea is to simply have all the elements move towards a point instead of animating it there via for example jQuery,

With this method you can change the point of which the elements are moving towards and by doing so creating smooth stateless animations.

This also removes the risk of an element flickering between two states in an animation when you change the animate before the other one is finished.
