<p>This is a javascript project i made for school.</p>

<p>The idea is to simply have all the elements move towards a point instead of animating it there via for example jQuery,</p>

<p>With this method you can change the point of which the elements are moving towards and by doing so creating smooth stateless animations.</p>

<p>This also removes the risk of an element flickering between two states in an animation when you change the animate before the other one is finished.</p>
